Attack trees are perhaps the most widely used graphical model for
conducting threat analysis of security critical systems.  Despite
their practical adoption there is still one basic question that
remains to be answered, what is an attack tree?  Many have put forth
an answer, and hence there are a number of models for attack trees,
but is there some common structure that can unify the various models?
In this talk, I will introduce a new research project whose goal is to
find this unifying framework by exploiting the powerful three
perspectives of computation, thus this project can be viewed as being
at the intersection of threat analysis using attack trees and
interactive theorem proving.  I will argue that the unifying structure
of all the various models of attack trees is the structure of a
monoidal category, and hence the correct logic for reasoning about
attack trees is linear logic.  Finally, by exploiting the three
perspectives of computation the project seeks to develop a new
domain-specific linear functional programming language called Lina –
for Linear Threat Analysis – for specifying and reasoning about attack
trees.
