abstract ={In an unpublished note Reddy introduced an extended intuitionistic linear calculus, called LLMS (for Linear Logic Model of State), to model state manipulation via the notions of sequential composition and ‘regenerative values’. His calculus introduces the connective ‘before’ ▹ and an associated modality †, for the storage of objects sequentially reusable. Earlier and independently de Paiva introduced a (collection of) dialectica categorical models for (classical and intuitionistic) Linear Logic, the categories Dial2Set. These categories contain, apart from the structure needed to model linear logic, an extra tensor product functor and an extra comonad structure corresponding to a modality related to the extra tensor product. It is surprising that these works arising from completely different motivations can be related in a meaningful way. In this article, following joint work with Corrêa and Haeusler, we first adapt Reddy's system LLMS providing a commutative version of the connective ‘before’ and its associated modality and then construct a dialectica category on Sets , which we show is a sound model for the modified version of Reddy's the system LLMSc. Moreover, following the work of Tucker, we provide another variant of the Dialectica categories with a non-commutative tensor and its associated modality, which models soundlyLLMS itself. We conclude with some speculation on future applications.},
