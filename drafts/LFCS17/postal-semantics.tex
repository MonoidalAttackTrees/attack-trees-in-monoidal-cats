Classical natural deduction has a semantics in boolean algebras, and
so the semantics in the previous section begs the question of whether
there is a natural deduction system that can be used to reason about
attack trees.  We answer this question in the positive, but before
defining the logic we first build up a non-trivial concrete
categorical model of our desired logic in dialectica spaces, but this
first requires the refinement of the quaternary semantics into a
postal semantics we call the lineale semantics of SAND attack trees.
This semantics will live at the base of the dialectica space model
given in the next section.

\newcommand{\Four}[0]{\mathsf{Four}} We denote by $\leq_4 : \Four
\times \Four \to \Four$ the obvious preorder on $\Four$ making
$(\Four, \leq_4)$ a preordered set (proset).  It is well known that
every preordered set induces a category whose objects are the elements
of the carrier set, here $\Four$, and morphisms $\Hom{\Four}{a}{b} = a
\leq_4 b$.  Composition of morphisms hold by transitivity and
identities exists by reflexivity.  Under this setting it is
straightforward to show that for any propositions $\phi$ and $\psi$
over $\Four$ we have $\phi \equiv \psi$ if and only if $\phi \leq_4
\psi$ and $\psi \leq_4 \phi$.  Thus, every result proven for the
logical connectives on $\Four$ in the previous section induce
properties on morphisms in this setting.

In addition to the induced properties just mentioned we also have the
following new ones which are required when lifting this semantics to
dialectica spaces, but are also important when building a
corresponding logic.
\begin{lemma}[Functorality]
  \label{lemma:functorality}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[] (Parallel Conjunction) For any $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, if $A \leq_4 C$ and $B \le_4 D$, then
    $(A \odot_4 B) \leq_4 (C \odot_4 D)$.\\
  \item[] (Sequential Conjunction) For any $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, if $A \leq_4 C$ and $B \le_4 D$, then
  $(A \rhd_4 B) \leq_4 (C \rhd_4 D)$.\\
  \item[] (Choice) For any $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, if $A \leq_4 C$ and $B \le_4 D$, then
  $(A \sqcup_4 B) \leq_4 (C \sqcup_4 D)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Part one holds by a straightforward case analysis on $A$, $B$, $C$,
  and $D$.  In any cases where $(A \odot_4 B) \leq_4 (C \odot_4 D)$
  does not hold, then one of the premises will also not hold.  The
  other cases are similar.
\end{proof}
The logic we a building up is indeed intuitionistic, but none of the
operators we have introduced thus far are closed, but we can define
the standard symmetric linear tensor product in $\Four$ that is
closed.
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:tensor-and-implication}
  The following defines the linear tensor product on $\Four$ as well
  as linear implication:  
    \begin{center}
      \begin{math}
        \setlength{\arraycolsep}{10px}
        \begin{array}{lll}
          \begin{array}{lll}
            A \otimes_4 B = \mathsf{max}(A,B), \\
          \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\text{where $A$ nor $B$ are $0$}\\
          A \otimes_4 B = 0, \text{otherwise}
          \end{array}
          &
          \begin{array}{lll}
          A \limp_4 B = 0, \text{where $B <_4 A$}\\
          A \limp_4 A = A, \text{where $A \in \{\forth,\half\}$}\\
          A \limp_4 B = 1, \text{otherwise}
        \end{array}
        \end{array}
      \end{math}
    \end{center}
    The unit of the tensor product is $I_4 = \forth$.\\   
\end{definition}
The expected monoidal properties hold for the tensor product.
\begin{lemma}[Tensor is Symmetric Monoidal Closed]
  \label{lemma:tensor_is_symmetric_monoidal_closed}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[] (Symmetry) For any $A$ and $B$, $A \otimes_4 B \equiv B \otimes A$.\\
  \item[] (Associativity) For any $A$, $B$, and $C$, $(A \otimes_4 B) \otimes_4 C \equiv A \otimes_4 (B \otimes_4 C)$.\\
  \item[] (Unitors) For any $A$, $(A \otimes I_4) \equiv A \equiv (I_4 \otimes A)$.\\
  \item[] (Tensor is Functorial) For any $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, if $A \leq_4 C$ and $B \le_4 D$, then
    $(A \otimes_4 B) \leq_4 (C \otimes_4 D)$.\\
  \item[] (Implication is Functorial) For any $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, if
    $C \leq_4 A$ and $B \leq_4 D$, then $(A \limp_4 B) \leq_4 (C
    \limp_4 D)$.\\
  \item[] (Closure) For any $A$, $B$, and $C$, $(A \otimes_4 B) \leq_4 C$ if and only if $A \leq_4 (B \limp_4 C)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  The top three cases hold by simply comparing truth tables. Finally,
  the last three cases hold by a case analysis over $A$, $B$, $C$, and
  $D$.  If at any time the conclusion is false, then one of the
  premises will also be false.
\end{proof}

We now define lineales which depend on the notion of a monoidal
proset.  The definition of lineales given here is a slight
generalization over the original definition given by Hyland and de
Paiva -- see Definition 1 of \cite{Hyland:1991}.  They base lineales
on posets instead of prosets, but the formalization given here shows
that anti-symmetry can be safely dropped.
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:monoidal-proset}
  A \textbf{monoidal proset} is a proset, $(L, \leq)$, with a given
  symmetric monoidal structure $(L, \circ, e)$.  That is, a set $L$
  with a given binary relation $\leq : L \times L \to L$ satisfying
  the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item (reflexivity) $a \leq a$ for any $a \in L$
  \item (transitivity) If $a \leq b$ and $b \leq c$, then $a \leq c$
  \end{itemize}
  together with a monoidal structure $(\circ, e)$ consisting of a
  binary operation, called multiplication, $\circ : L \times L \to L$
  and a distinguished element $e \in L$ called the unit such that the
  following hold:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item (associativity) $(a \circ b) \circ c = a \circ (b \circ c)$
  \item (identity) $a \circ e = a = e \circ a$
  \item (symmetry) $a \circ b = b \circ a$
  \end{itemize}
  Finally, the structures must be compatible, that is, if $a \leq b$,
  then $a \circ c \leq b \circ c$ for any $c \in L$.
\end{definition}
Now a lineale can be seen as essentially a symmetric monoidal closed
category in the category prosets.
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:lineale}
  A \textbf{lineale} is a monoidal proset, $(L, \leq, \circ, e)$, with
  a given binary operation, called implication, $\limp : L \times L
  \to L$ such that the following hold:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item (relative complement) $(a \limp b) \circ a \leq b$ 
  \item (adjunction) If $a \circ y \leq b$, then $y \leq a \limp b$
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}
The set $\mathsf{2} = \{0,1\}$ is an example of a lineale where the
order is the usual one, the multiplication is boolean conjunction, and
the implication is boolean implication.  This example is not that
interesting, because $\mathsf{2}$ is a boolean algebra.  An example of
a proper lineale can be given using the three element set
$\mathsf{Three} = \{0,\half, 1\}$, but one must be careful when
defining lineales, because it is possible to instead define Heyting
algebras, and hence, become nonlinear.

Given the operations and properties shown for $(\Four, \leq_4)$ above
we can easily prove that $(\Four, \leq_4)$ defines a lineale.
\begin{lemma}
  \label{lemma:four_is_a_lineale}
  The proset, $(\Four, \leq_4, \otimes_4, I_4, \limp_4)$ is a lineale.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  First, $(\Four, \leq_4, \otimes_4, I_4)$ defines a monoidal proset,
  because the tensor product is associative, $I_4$ is the identity,
  and symmetric by
  Lemma~\ref{lemma:tensor_is_symmetric_monoidal_closed}.  We can also
  show that the tensor product is compatible, that is, if $A \leq_4
  B$, then $(A \otimes_4 C) \leq_4 (B \otimes C)$ for any $C$.
  Suppose $A \leq_4 B$, then by reflexivity we also know that $C
  \leq_4 C$.  Thus, by functorality,
  Lemma~\ref{lemma:tensor_is_symmetric_monoidal_closed}, we obtain our
  result.

  Finally, we show that $(\Four, \leq_4, \otimes_4, I_4, \limp_4)$ is
  a lineale.  The adjunction property already holds by
  Lemma~\ref{lemma:tensor_is_symmetric_monoidal_closed}, thus, all
  that is left to show is that the relative complement holds. We know
  by Lemma~\ref{lemma:tensor_is_symmetric_monoidal_closed} that for
  any $A$, $B$, and $C$, if $A \leq_4 (B \limp_4 C)$, then $(A
  \otimes_4 B) \leq_4 C$.  In addition, we know by reflexivity that
  $(A \limp_4 B) \leq_4 (A \limp_4 B)$, thus by the previous property we obtain
  that $((A \limp_4 B) \otimes_4 A) \leq_4 B$.
\end{proof}
