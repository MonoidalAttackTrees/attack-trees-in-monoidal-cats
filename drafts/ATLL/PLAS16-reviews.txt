                        ===== Paper summary =====

Proposes linear logic and its categorical foundation in symmetric monoidal
categories as an elegant and useful mathematical presentation of attack
trees.  A new programming language, Lina, is being developed on the basis of
this presentation.

                     ===== Comments for author =====

The project looks potentially interesting, but I question whether the paper
in its present form will have a large audience -- the writing is quite
careless throughout, and significant background in category theory is
implicitly assumed.

Detailed comments:

- "The example above implies that attack trees are a modeling tool..."??

- The paragraph "By far the most..." in the intro is confusing -- e.g.,
 "furthermore" didn't make sense to me.

- The paper needs a thorough copy-edit for grammar and spelling issues.

- The introduction of the new operators in section 2 is quite abrupt.  I
 expected we were just modeling vanilla attack trees as in the example in
 the intro.  Also, what happened to the cost annotations?

- Section 2 is hard to understand without going back to Jhawar '15.

- I don't understand what kind of interaction between t1 and t2 is possible
 in t1 \tensor t2.  There don't seem to be any communication primitives.

- I didn't get much out of section 3, not having understood 2 very well and
 not being familiar with dialectica spaces.

                        ===== Paper summary =====

This paper studies a formal semantics of attack trees: tree-like structures useful to
describe the security of systems where the root of the tree represents
the attack goal and the leafs describe different ways to achieve the
goal. The paper proposes a semantics for attack trees based on
monoidal categories and discusses a linear functional language
grounded in this semantics that can be used to describe formally
attack trees.

                     ===== Comments for author =====

This short paper presents preliminary results about an ongoing
project.  While I find the technical ideas described in the short
paper quite interesting, I find the main motivations quite
disappointing. Attack trees are an important formalism that has been
extensively studied in the recent years. The author proposes a new
categorical semantics for them and establishes a formal relation with
linear logic but it is unclear what new this semantics give us with
respect to previous formalisms - besides having now a categorical
formalization for attack trees.
The paper fails to communicate the broader interest of this semantics
and why we should care in having the relation with linear logic. The
paper doesn't give many insights about what this new models should teach
us about attack trees. This is also the case for the functional
language that the author present: what is the main purpose of the language? is it a
description language? Does it have an operational semantics? what the
semantics give us? 
I also find unclear whether it is the right choice to separate the
logical structure from the numeric one. It seems that a good
semantics/language for attack trees should be able to use the
interplay of the logical structure with the numeric one in some more
interesting way. More discussions about this point would have been
useful.

Summarizing, while I find this paper technically interesting I find
its motivations rather weak.

                     Overall merit: 3. Weak accept (OK paper, but I won't
                                       champion it.)
                Reviewer expertise: 2. Some familiarity

                        ===== Paper summary =====

This paper proposes to formalize the semantics of attack trees using category theory. Using Curry-Howard isomorphism, the paper proposes a language for specifying attack trees. The types of the language specify structures of attack tree.

                     ===== Comments for author =====

Assigning formal semantics to attack trees is an interesting and important problem. The authors concisely pointed out the inadequacies of interpretations based on propositional logic. Using category theory as the mathematical foundation for the semantics of attack trees seems to be an interesting theoretical exercise. 

I wish the authors could be more explicit about what additional properties or theorems that can be proven due to the Dialectica Space semantics. It is unclear to me what is the key benefits of using category theory.
