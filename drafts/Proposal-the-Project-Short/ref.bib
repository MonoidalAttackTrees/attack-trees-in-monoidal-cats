abstract ={In an unpublished note Reddy introduced an extended intuitionistic linear calculus, called LLMS (for Linear Logic Model of State), to model state manipulation via the notions of sequential composition and ‘regenerative values’. His calculus introduces the connective ‘before’ ▹ and an associated modality †, for the storage of objects sequentially reusable. Earlier and independently de Paiva introduced a (collection of) dialectica categorical models for (classical and intuitionistic) Linear Logic, the categories Dial2Set. These categories contain, apart from the structure needed to model linear logic, an extra tensor product functor and an extra comonad structure corresponding to a modality related to the extra tensor product. It is surprising that these works arising from completely different motivations can be related in a meaningful way. In this article, following joint work with Corrêa and Haeusler, we first adapt Reddy's system LLMS providing a commutative version of the connective ‘before’ and its associated modality and then construct a dialectica category on Sets , which we show is a sound model for the modified version of Reddy's the system LLMSc. Moreover, following the work of Tucker, we provide another variant of the Dialectica categories with a non-commutative tensor and its associated modality, which models soundlyLLMS itself. We conclude with some speculation on future applications.},

Which in turn can be analysed with Uppaal, resulting in different types of analysis and thus in additional possibilities for results. This thesis provides a meta-modelling approach to the transformation of input ATs from ADTool into an instance of Uppaal. For this to work, we also introduce the Attack Tree Meta Model (ATMM) which is used as an intermediate model. The Epsilon Transformation Language (ETL) is used for the model-to-model transformations and the Epsilon Generation Language (EGL) for the model-to-text. As a ?nal deliverable all the transformations and the internal ATMM are included in a standalone java tool, which can transform ADTool input into a Uppaal model which can be used for Attack Tree analysis.}

Therefore, this project focuses on generating attack trees automatically from 
a given model that describes a system or organization. It improves upon previous 
efforts by providing an approach to identify all possible attacks from a 
given model in a more scalable manner, compared to the previous approach of 
constructing an attack graph, while remaining (security-)domain independent. 

This work demonstrates that this new approach, based on partial-order 
reduction, can have significant scalability benefits compared to the 
existing generic approach.

In addition, it is shown that the graph transformations modeling paradigm 
can be used as a generic input language for describing systems and organizations, and 
using graph transformations gives the benefit of reusing existing efforts 
and implementations. Specifically, a partial-order technique called the unfolding of a graph transformation system is used as the basis of the approach, and GROOVE, a tool for constructing and analyzing graph transformation systems, is used as the basis of the implementation.}
