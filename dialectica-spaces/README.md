Dialectica Spaces
-----------------

This is a formalization of dialectica spaces in the two flavors from
Valeria de Paiva's thesis.  The first flavor is DC over Sets and the
second is GC over sets.  We call the latter Dial over Sets.

Each type of space requires the notion of a lineale:

- Defined in [lineale.agda](lineale.agda)
- Theorems about lineales can be found in [lineale-thms.agda](lineale-thms.agda)
